Example code for bug: Unexpected behaviour of Fortran OpenMP code

example_routine.F90 contains a stripped-down reproduction of the original 
routine in which the bug is manifested in ONETEP. Most of the functionality 
and dependencies on other modules in ONETEP have been removed. Procedure 
and variable names differ to the original code.

This is provided to provide context for the bug and demonstrate the 
general structure of the routine in which it is manifested.
