Example code for bug: Unexpected behaviour of Fortran OpenMP code

This is a new minimal working example, build starting from a stripped down
version of the original routine in which the code. This appears to reproduce 
the original problem for the Intel Compiler 17.0.2.

We identified that the bug also appears to be related to optimization in the
Intel Fortran compiler. With the -g flag, the issue disappears, but that implies
-O0. Adding -O1 brings the issue back. The next step would be to interrogate the
optimization options to see if we can find if a specific optimization is causing
this issue.

The issue does not appear to occur for Intel Fortran 18.0.0, regardless of
optimization level, or compilation with/without OpenMP. We have also not
seen the issue in GFortran or PGI Fortran, so it seems likely that this
was a compiler bug associated with OpenMP and optimization which has been
resolved since Intel Fortran version 17.0.2.
