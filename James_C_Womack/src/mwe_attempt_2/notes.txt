Example code for bug: Unexpected behaviour of Fortran OpenMP code

This is a new minimal working example, build starting from a stripped down
version of the original routine in which the code. This appears to reproduce 
the original problem for the Intel Compiler 17. 

We identified that the bug also appears to be related to optimization in the
Intel Fortran compiler. With the -g flag, the issue disappears, but that implies
-O0. Adding -O1 brings the issue back. The next step would be to interrogate the
optimization options to see if we can find if a specific optimization is causing
this issue.
