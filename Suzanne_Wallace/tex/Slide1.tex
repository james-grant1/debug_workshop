\frametitle{Segmentation fault in on-lattice disorder Monte Carlo code}

\begin{itemize}
\item Monte Carlo code written in C to simulate on-lattice disorder in the cation sub-lattice of Cu$_2$ZnSnS$_4$
\item `Segmentation fault: 11' during runtime
\item Note that equilibration steps has been reduced to an unphysical number in current version of code just to reach the bug sooner! 
\item Compilation instructions for Balena: Code requires libconfig, `module load intel', `make cx1-icc' (Makefile instructions for the HPC facility at Imperial College London)
\item *Should* work on local linux machines (and maybe on Macs after getting libconfig): `sudo apt-get install libconfig-dev' and then just use `make' (default option in the Makefile)
\item See git repo for more details: https://github.com/WMD-group/Eris
\end{itemize}
