    \begin{itemize}
       \item  {\bf Overview:} Idealised code to illustrate a hidden non-critical bug
                              recently discovered in our NAME dispersion model
       \item  {\bf Model:}    Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment
                              (UK Met Office)
       \item  {\bf Language:} Fortran (90 + some 2003 features)
       \item  {\bf Issue:}    A seemingly straightforward update to an attribute of some
                              derived type components from 'pointer' to 'allocatable'
                              caused a run-time failure for a certain type of NAME
                              application. Why? ... and were there any underlying
                              issues with the previous code?
