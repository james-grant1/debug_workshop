    \framesubtitle{Andrew Jones, Met Office}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item  {\bf Bug:}            Code attempts to 'Allocate' some allocatable
                                    arrays that are already allocated
       \item  {\bf Identified by:}  A helpful run-time error message and traceback!
       \item  {\bf Our Solution:}   Guard 'Allocate' statements by an if-test
                                    for existing allocation \ldots or deallocate
                                    (this was already done for other arrays
                                    elsewhere in the code)
       \item  {\bf Legacy issue:}   Bug had remained hidden in earlier code
                                    for many years. This would have resulted
                                    in a slight memory leak but it was never spotted
                                    as i) overall memory effect was small, and
                                    ii) multiple-case option was rarely used in NAME.
