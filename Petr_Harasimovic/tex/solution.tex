\begin{itemize}
   \item{Surprisingly, was not too painful because
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item{did not know the code was correct \smiley{}}
         \item{lot of bugs of that kind}
         \item{number of hot fixes available}
         \item{was lucky, generally hard to detect}
      \end{enumerate}
      }
   \item{Bug might have stayed for about two years before resolved, but was not affecting the code (hot fixed)
   \item{Generally, compiler bugs very painful}
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item{Another compiler bug took me three days and required major re-design}
          \item{Using many different compilers can help a lot (includes different versions of the same compiler)}
      \end{enumerate}
