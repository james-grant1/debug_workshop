\begin{itemize}
\item Bug appeared in a dispersion model and gave unfeasible values which caused
the code to get stuck in a loop
\item This is a specially constructed bug which illustrates simply the issue and
the solution
\item Finds the root of the equation $1-\erf(x) = c$ (where $c$ is a constant)
by interval bisection
\item Now $1-\erf(x) = \erfc(x)$
\item Also finds the root of the equation $\erfc(x) = c$ by interval bisection
\item Why are the results different and which is correct?
\end{itemize}
